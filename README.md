# IMENMANSOUR_Task2
# Streamlit AI Q&A Application

This project is a Streamlit-based web application where the user can ask questions, and the AI responds based on a dataset.

## Requirements

To run this application, follow these steps:

### 1. Set up Google Colab

- Open the `colab.ipynb` script in Google Colab.

### 2. Upload Files

- Upload the following files in your Google Colab environment:
  - `QA.txt`: This file contains the dataset.
  - `app.py`: This is the main Streamlit application file.

### 3. Create a Gemini API Key

- You need a Gemini API key to interact with the AI. Create your Gemini API key and add it to the `app.py` file.
  
  In `app.py`, find the section where the API key is defined, and explicitly replace the placeholder with your actual API key.

```python
gemini_api_key = "YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE"
4. Run the Colab Cells
Run all the cells in the Colab notebook. This will set up the environment and install all the necessary dependencies.
5. Start the Streamlit App
After running all cells in the Colab notebook, run the following command in the last cell to start the Streamlit application and expose it via a local tunnel:

bash
Copy code
!streamlit run app.py & npx localtunnel --port 8501
This command will provide a URL that you can use to access your Streamlit app.

6. Access the Streamlit App
Run the following command in the Google Colab to get your public IP address:
bash
Copy code
!wget -q -O - ipv4.icanhazip.com
Copy the provided IP address and paste it into the local tunnel URL provided by the previous command. The URL will look something like this:

arduino
Copy code
https://<random-id>.loca.lt
You can replace <random-id> with the one generated by the localtunnel command.
